Compiling

After having set the correct paths to NA62MC and NA62Reconstruction in env script and executed it
typing 
       source path/to/script 
then just type 
       make 
from the top directory (you need to have previously compiled at least all Persistency libs in NA62MC)


Program running

NA62Analysis -h for help.
NA62EventDisplay has the same syntax (for now it has not
been tested with more than few events ... in next releases there will be more control on
event processing) 


Known Issues and Bugs

- NA62EventDisplay needs stable GL features of your video card, otherwise it is not stable itself.
